# Basic I/O using `cin` and `cout` - Standard library
## `cout` 
- Standard output stream
- console/screen 
## `cin`
- standard input stream
- keyboard
## `<<`
- Insertion operator
- output streams
- Insert the data into the cout stream
``` C++
// insert data into the cout stream
`cout << data;`
// can be chained
can be chained -> `cout << "data 1 is " << data1;
// doesn't automatically add line breaks
cout << "data 1 is " << data1 << endl; // option 1. With this option, it will also FLUSH the stream
cout << "data 1 is " << data 1 << "\n" // option 2
```
## `>>`
- extraction operator
- input streams
- The information is interpreted based on the type of the variabe we are saving the stream 
	- Can fail if the entered data cannot be interpreted.  `data` have an undetermined value
``` C++
// Extract data from the cin stream based on data's type
cin >> data; 
// Can be chained
cin >> data1 >> data2;
```
